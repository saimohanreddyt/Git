Version Control System
------- ------- ------
> Version control is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. These changes are usually termed as "versions".
> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. 

Storing Versions
------- --------
> Snapshots of all versions are properly documented and stored.
> Versions are also named accurently

Backup
------
In any case if your central server crashes, a backup is always avaliable in your local servers.

Analyze:
--------
	> VCS provides you with proper description
	> What exactly was changes
	> When it was changed
	And hence, you can analyze how your projects evolved between versions.
